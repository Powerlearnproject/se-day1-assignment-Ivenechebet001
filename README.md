Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a systematic application of engineering principles,methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.It involves the design,development,testing,deployment,and maintenance of software product.
importance of software engineering is that,it enables creation of software applicationss and systems that power various aspects of modernlife,including communication,commerce,entertainment and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages(e.g Fortan,c)
Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
The advent of structured in the 1970s
The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements:Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design:Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
Implementation:Writing code ad building the software according to the design specifications
Testing:Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment:Releasing the software to the users or customers
Maintenance:Providing ongoing support,updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall                                           agile 
-Sequential and structred                           - Iterative and incremental
-Changes are difficult to accommodate                - Can adapt to changes
-Well-defined projects with clear                    -Projects with evolving or unclear requirements
 requirements 
-Higher risk due to late testing and feeback         -Lower risk due to ogoing testing and feedback 
-Minimal till the end                                -Continuous collaboration 
feedback


Where they are used
Warefall
-Manufacturing and construction, like in building bridges where all requirements are determined before construction begins.
-Medical software ;Developing medical imaging software that requires extensice testing regulatory approval before release.
-In large government or enterprise projects ;example military software development

 Agile 
 -Software startup and tech companies
 -E-commerce and web development
 -Gme development
 -Cloud -Based and SaaS Products






Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer -Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer-Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager- Oversees the planning ,executions,and delivery of software projects.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs-Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing ,debugging and testing codes(e.g Visual studio,Eclipse,Intellij IDEA)
VCS-software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g Git,Subversion)


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements:Requirements may change during the development cycle,leading to scope creep and projects delays.
Tight deadlines:Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
Technical debt: Accured from shortcuts or suboptimals solutions ,technical debts can impede future development effors and increase maintenance costs.
Strategies for overcoming challenges:Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication,agile methodologies,priotization of tasks,and regular reassesment of project goals and timelines



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing Testing individuals components or module software
Intergration testing Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole 
Acceptance testing Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Their importance is that they help identify and fix defects early in development process ,leading to higher-quality software products.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Is the practise of crafting effective prompts to guide AI to generate the most useful and relevant responses,to avoid vague responses.
Its importance include;
Enhance AI performance interms of relevant responses
Improve efficiency which reduces the need for follow up querries
Ensures Contextual accuracy




Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt
Tell me about technology 

Improved Prompt 
Explain the impact of AI on health care industry,including benefits and challenges

Why the improved prompt is more effective
Specific topic -Focuses on AI rather than all technology
Clear context -Specifes the industry (healthcare)
Concise yet detailed-Asks for both benefits and challenges,ensuring a balanced response
